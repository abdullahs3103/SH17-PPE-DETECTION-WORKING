# SH17-PPE-DETECTION-WORKING
Hi Elena,
I have trained the model on the latest dataset on Kaggle (SH17 Dataset for PPE Detection) I shared. I have created a Kaggle notebook for your testing. I have also tested it using different videos (some stock footage and some factory videos from social media). I have also attached the Google Drive links to my videos tested and processed by the model in the text files. You may have a look over these videos.

A brief overview of the files in this repository is as follows:

1- (notebook) sh17dataset-model-testing: In this notebook, I have added the codes for you to test run the model performance on the trained dataset. On each run iteration, it selects random images from the test set and processes them. Notebook Structure is;
	i- Added the code cells for the video dataset (videos that I downloaded from the internet) to process them and generate the output.
	ii- Added the code cell for the testing of the AVIOX factory video. I have also provided the Google Drive folder link to the original and processed video by the model. you may check the processed video there. 
	iii- Added the code cell for you to test any video.

2- MODEL WEIGHTS LINK.TXT: IT CONTAINS THE DRIVE LINK OF THE MODEL TRAINED.
3- FSVIDEOS.TXT: IT CONTAINS THE DRIVE LINK OF THE FSVIDEOS DATASET WHICH I USED. PLEASE ADD THE PATHS, RUN THE CODE, AND GET THE OUTPUT PROCESSED VIDEOS.
4- AVIOXFACTORY.TXT: IT CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL AND PROCESSED VIDEO BY THE MODEL. (DRIVE LINK)
